# Rubik’s Cube Color Detection

## About the Project
This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect the colors of a Rubik’s Cube face from images or live camera input.

## Features
- Detects cube sticker colors using HSV color space
- Supports image-based input and webcam input
- Represents each cube face as a 3×3 color matrix
- Modular and easy to extend

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
2. Run image-based detection:
3. Run camera-based detection:

## Limitations
- Accuracy depends on lighting conditions
- Reflections and shadows can affect color detection
- Solver logic is not implemented in this version

## Purpose
This project was developed as an academic project to understand computer vision and image processing concepts.
